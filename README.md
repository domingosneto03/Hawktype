# HawkType

HawkType is a typing game inspired by <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">MonkeyType</a>, where the player must type the phrase displayed on the screen as accurately and quickly as possible. The game tests the user's keyboard reflexes, accuracy, and typing speed under a visually engaging interface built for the Minix environment.

## Features
- Create an interactive application using **LCOMâ€™s I/O devices**:
  - `Keyboard`: For user input and control
  - `Mouse`: For menu navigation and in-game UI
  - `Timer`: For handling time constraints and animations
- Develop the full system within the constraints of **Minix**
- Apply concepts of *low-level programming*, *interrupt handling*, and *device drivers*

## Compile and Run
```bash
$ make
$ lcom_run proj
```
